### Contribution guidelines and standards

Before sending your pull request for
[review](https://github.com/YDS-Med/Transformer3D/pulls),
make sure your changes are consistent with the guidelines and follow the
PyTorch coding style.

#### General guidelines and philosophy for contribution

*   Include unit tests when you contribute new features, as they help to a)
    prove that your code works correctly, and b) guard against future breaking
    changes to lower the maintenance cost.
*   Bug fixes also generally require unit tests, because the presence of bugs
    usually indicates insufficient test coverage.
*   When you contribute a new feature to Transformer3D, the maintenance burden is
    (by default) transferred to the YDS team. This means that the benefit
    of the contribution must be compared against the cost of maintaining the
    feature.
